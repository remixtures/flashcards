If you are still in school/college or getting ready for any kind of professional exam, you know that you are required to memorize lots of new words. 

This Java and command-line-based application helps you to do just that. Even though it only has a text interface, it can be enhanced with any kind of graphical interface. You can even manage to import and export flashcards, i.e., pairs of terms and definitions both directly from your operating system's terminal or once you are already running the program. An additional feature of this Hyperskill project is that you can even check which terms are more difficult for you to memorize. 

Features:

1 - add: create a new flashcard with a unique name and definition;

2 - remove: delete a specific card according to its name;

3 - import: load all the cards saved to a given existing file.

4 - export: save all the cards created up to that moment to a given file (either already existing or completely new);

5 - ask: enter the number of cards you want to study and guess the definitions of a randomly set of terms previously added as cards. 

6 - log: save all the input/output lines generated by the program to a given file.  

7 - hardest card: find the terms of all the cards with the highest number of wrong answers.

8 - reset stats: if you are feeling lousy because you are failing on too many cards, you can always set the number of errors of all the cards to zero ;-)

9 - exit: when you had enough of studying...
